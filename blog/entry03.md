# Entry 3
##### 2/5/24

Process: For 2 month's now, I have continued learning kaboomjs in my own spare time, and in class. I have made it quite far in my learning process. For instance on 10/12/23, I tried to learn how to use outline(), and body(). For the outline(w, c), I first tried to write outline(6, BLUE) to give my kaboom sprite an outline of width 6 and color blue. Then I tried changing the values of the width to multiple numbers like 1, 2, and 100. As for the color, I tried using rgb values instead of key words to get a specific color. However, despite all the changing non of it worked.
